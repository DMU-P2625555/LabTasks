    <h1 style="color: yellow"> Dogs Become Valuable Employees at Bank </h1>
    <p style="color: white"> It was revealed this morning at a major high street bank has
      <strong style="color: white"> begun employing clever canines </strong>
      to perform basic data-entry tasks in several of it's UK data centres.
      In a statement earlier today a spokesperson for the bank said that the
      training had gone well with the

        <p style="color: white"> "I've made new friends, we have a great canteen,
          and in a few months I will have earned enough to put a
          deposit down on a new kennel."

          <h2 style="color: yellow"> Here are the top 3 reasons Dogs have decided to work for
            the bank </h2>
          <ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman ; "color: white"">
            <li style="color: white"> They make good companions </li>
            <li style="color: white"> They're always early </li>
            <li style="color: white"> They're good boys </li>
      <h2 style="color: yellow"> Businesses suited to animal employees </h2>
      <p style="color: white"> Many businesses could benefit from embracing our feathered and
        furry friends in the workplace. </p>
      <h3 style="color: yellow"> Cafes </h3>
      <p style="color: white"> Perhaps you've been to a cat cafe already? Relax with a coffee and
        be soothed by the elegant slow dance and soft purring
        of some feline friends. </p>
      <h3 style="color: yellow"> Hospitals </h3>
      <p style="color: white"> Hospitals often have a need to move small things like sample tubes
        and paperwork to other parts of the hospital quickly, often along long
        narrow corridors. Parrots would be perfectly suited to this role, and
        would also help brighten things up, adding a little cheer for those
        enjoying a temporary stay.</p>
      <h3 style="color: yellow"> Window Cleaning </h3>
      <p style="color: white"> If window cleaners used Pelicans to hold their water, instead of
        carrying a bucket up a ladder, it's estimated that 356 window
        cleaning injuries a year could be avoided.
        They're also good company on a lunch break. </p>
